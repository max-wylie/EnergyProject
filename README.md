# **Energy Demand and Generation Analysis**

**Overview**

This project is an analysis of energy demand and generation data from Northern Ireland (NI), Ireland (IE), and the entire island (AI). It includes visualizations, statistical analysis, and forecasting models for energy demands and generation patterns. The data analyzed spans from 2022 to 2023, focusing on various energy aspects such as wind and solar generation, demand, and system non-synchronous penetration (SNSP).

**Key Features**

- Time Series Analysis: Visualizes demand and generation patterns over time for NI, IE, and AI.
- Wind Generation vs. Wind Availability: Explores the relationship between wind availability and actual wind generation.
- SNSP Analysis: Assesses the System Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP) and detects cases where it exceeds the 75% limit.
- Forecasting: Utilizes ARIMA and LSTM models to forecast energy demand.
- Correlation Heatmap: Displays the correlation between various energy metrics to uncover relationships.
- Oversupply Analysis: Investigates instances of oversupply in the energy grid.
- Solar Generation Analysis: Focuses on solar generation patterns from April 2023 onwards.
- Wind Penetration Analysis: Visualizes wind energy penetration for NI, IE, and AI.
  
**Technologies Used**

- Python: Main programming language.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for visualizing data.
- ARIMA: Time series forecasting model from the statsmodels library.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model for demand prediction using TensorFlow.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and analysis.
  
**Project Status**

This is a project that focuses on learning the basics of energy data analysis and forecasting using both statistical and machine learning approaches. The project may be extended with further analysis or more advanced models in the future.
